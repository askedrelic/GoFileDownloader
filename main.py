"""Main module of the project.

This module provides functionality for reading URLs from a file, processing
them to download anime content, and clearing the file after the process is
complete.

Usage:
    Ensure that a file named 'URLs.txt' is present in the same directory as
    this script. The file should contain a list of URLs, one per line. When
    executed, the script will:
        1. Read the URLs from 'URLs.txt'.
        2. Process each URL for downloading anime content.
        3. Clear the contents of 'URLs.txt' after all URLs have been processed.
